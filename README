Raincheck (version 0.0.1, 12/19/2013)
=====================================

Raincheck is a minimal R package that allows you to put messy code to
reformat and check a function's arguments *outside* that function.
For example:

    greatfunction <- function(x1, x2, x3 = NULL) {
      MakeXsCorrect()
      ## great code that does great things
      ## ...
      return(results)
    }

    MakeXsCorrect <- raincheck({
      x1 <- as.greatobject1(x1)
      x2 <- as.greatobject2(x2)
      x3 <- as.therightthing(x1, x2, x3)
      ## Many more steps to get the xs in the right format
      ## ...
    })

The assignments `x1 <- as.greatobject(x1)`, etc., operate on the copy
of `x1` in `greatfunction`.

Why do this? `MakeXsCorrect` can contain a lot of confusing
boilerplate code that is peripheral to the main point of the
function. In those cases, this structure can be more readable than
putting the code directly in the function.
